 Machine Learning Introduction

    Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data and improve performance without being explicitly programmed.

Key features

📊 Data-driven – learns patterns from data

🤖 Self-improving – performance improves with more data

🧠 Predictive – makes predictions or decisions

🔁 Automated learning – reduces manual rule-based coding

📈 Scalable – works with large and complex datasets

🌐 Wide applications – used in vision, speech, recommendation, fraud detection
